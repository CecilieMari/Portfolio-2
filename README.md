# 💼 Portfolio Website – Cecilie Mari Monsen

This is my personal portfolio website, built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), React, Bootstrap, and React Router.  
The purpose of this project is to present my school assignments in a clean, professional, and editorial-inspired design.  
The portfolio also includes an “About Me” section that introduces who I am, my background, and my creative process.

💬 Reflection
Building this portfolio was an opportunity to combine technical development with my love for design.
I experimented with layout, typography, and color balance to achieve a calm, editorial aesthetic.
Through this project, I’ve gained more confidence in React structure, routing, and component reusability — and learned how to communicate my work visually and professionally.
